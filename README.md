# DFFN
This is an implementation of the DFFN network presented in the paper "Hyperspectral Image Classification With Deep Feature Fusion Network".
The original implementation of the network is in Matlab, using the Caffe Framework (https://github.com/weiweisong415/Demo_DFFN_for_TGRS2018)

# Tested with
Python 3.9

Pytorch 1.9.0  

CPU or GPU

# Run the DFFN (STILL NOT FUNCTIONAL)
Please set your parameters in train.py or test.py before runing them. 

To train, run:
```python
# Still not functional
python train.py
``` 

To test, run:
```python
# Not yet implemented
python test.py
```

# About datasets and checkpoints
The datasets is available in http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
